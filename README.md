Repository for NBE-E4530 - Special Course in Human Neuroscience V / Human brain connectivity

# My goals for the course

## Main goal
The course web site (https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=19534#section-0) has a following list of _learning outcomes_ for the course:
**Learning outcomes**: After this course, the participant is able to
    1. List the common functional human brain networks in clinical and healthy populations.
    2. Explain methodological approaches, including their pitfalls, for assessing/estimating brain functional connectivity.
    3. Analyse and visualize brain connectivity data.
    4. Report and share results using online platforms such as github and neurovault.
    5. Critically study scientific literature and evaluate new findings on brain connectivity.

...so naturally these are what I would like to learn during the course.

## Side goal
Well to be truthful, this goal isn't really separate from the main goal, but I'd really like to refresh my knowledge on complex networks and graph theory and also learn something new about them along with some good tools related to the subject.

Since a table was compulsory, but I really ran out of imagination at this point, here's a table of tables currently visible to me, so actually several tables:
| Table type  | Color       | 
|-------------|-------------| 
| Living room | Dark brown  | 
| Dinner      | Light brown | 
| Kitchen     | Black       |
